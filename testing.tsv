OT	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
OT	The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
OT	Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.
OT	And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.
OT	God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.
OT	Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.
OT	And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.
OT	Then God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear"; and it was so.
OT	And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
OT	Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth"; and it was so.
OT	And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
OT	So the evening and the morning were the third day.
NT	But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
NT	And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins."
NT	So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
NT	"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel," which is translated, "God with us."
NT	Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,
NT	and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name JESUS.
NT	Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
NT	saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him."
NT	When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
NT	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
NT	So they said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:
NT	"But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, Are not the least among the rulers of Judah; For out of you shall come a Ruler Who will shepherd My people Israel."'
NT	Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared.
NT	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also."
NT	When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.
NT	When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
Quran	except those who are steadfast
Quran	and constant in their prayers.
Quran	They are those who assign a certain share of their property
Quran	who acknowledge the Day of Judgment,
Quran	who are afraid of the torment of their Lord,
Quran	the punishment of their Lord is not something for them to feel secure of,
Quran	who guard their carnal desires
Quran	except from their wives and slave girls, in which case they are not to be blamed,
Quran	but whoever goes beyond this is a transgressor;
Quran	who honor their trust and promises,
Quran	who testify to what they have witnessed,
Quran	such people will receive due honor in Paradise.
Quran	What is wrong with the disbelievers who roam around you (Muhammad),
Quran	left and right, in numerous groups?
Quran	Does every one of them desire to enter the bountiful Paradise?
Quran	By no means! For they know very well out of what We have created them (The human being's naturally growing from a living germ, without discipline and good deeds will not result in virtue).
Quran	I do not need to swear by the Lord of the eastern and western regions that We have certainly all the power
Quran	to replace them by a better people and none can challenge Our power.
